We visited this mall to spend some evening time. Parking area was good. Washrooms were clean. They have good shopping /restaurants / Theatre options. Overall it was a good vibe. We had some food and played Ice hockey. We then did some window shopping. Theatre was screening Tenant movie at the time. Recommended to visit.
