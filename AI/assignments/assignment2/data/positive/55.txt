Good location. Its located in the middle of the city and approachable by the people from all cornors. I visit here mostly for the movies which usually start on time. Apart from the the mall is average and I would prefer to visit dyp for window shopping or actual shopping.
I would recommend dyp for shopping or gathering and reliance mall for movies, https://indiapl.com/maharashtra/reliance-mall-13522
