Right from the receptionist to everyone in the hotel… from food to room service everything is just the worst and not at all worth it…. Sagar, Ishwar and Juhi are the only staff who really care for the guests in the hotel… everyone else is least bothered…. Worst ever food experience…. Food quality and stale and pathetic
