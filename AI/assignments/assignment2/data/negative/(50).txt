We stayed during Christmas for 2 nights. Rooms have modern facilities with tab based system.

But beyond that, room was smelly and needs urgent maintenance. Bathroom is very small .

Breakfast venue had lot of mosquitoes and can do with touch up as you do not feel like having food in current set up which is quite small.

Good location but overpriced unless it spends that money in maintenance and renewal of the property.
