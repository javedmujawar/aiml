we stayed at this for a short while. We had requested for twin room however instead were given a double room. I specifically had called to request for twin beds.
Reception were very hospitable and we were given room on 9th floor.
Room was decent but can do better with cleaning and also there was a very bad smell in room. Possible it was recently renovated.
