This is my 3rd visit to this hotel staying two weeks on all occasions.
The hotel is fine and food very India orientated with little English food, but still ok. You have 3 restaurants of choice which I preferred the poolside restaurant as greater selection.

The only problem been the entertainment, the nightly singer is awful, really awful.....
Change required
