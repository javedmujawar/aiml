House keeping was good, however reception wasn't ok. They missed my buffet meal even after confirmation over the mail. During check out I had to wait for more than 40 mins for my cab which was also confirmed and reminded on previous night. Due to this, I was very close to miss my flight. Not happy at all with front desk.
