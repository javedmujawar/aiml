The DYP City mall near the DYPatil group owned Sayaji Hotel, lies a medium to small sized mall, where 2-3 brands like Shoppers Stop, PVR, McDonalds etc occupy majority of the real estate. It has a food court too with some cuisine choices. Not a great place, but the locals seems to appreciate this mall a lot. My family watched a movie at the PVR cinema in this mall.
